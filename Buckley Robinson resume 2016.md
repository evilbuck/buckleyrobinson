## Summary

### I've worked on:
- Ad serving platforms and tracking systems serving/tracking in the hundreds of billions per day.
- Student Data Collection System with 508 compliance
- Building out microservice architecture where it makes sense
- UX design, both customer and internally facing.
- Data analysis and recommendations for ad serving.
- Emailing platforms, with server rotation rules

### My Next Journey
I'm looking to grow and solve new problems. I like finding real [human] value in my problem solving. This could be UX for end users, a better experience for an internal team member, or optimization of productivity. I like solving problems in an elegant way.
